# john-15-1

A small deployable website that can be used to study John 15 of the Bible! It is made using Vue & Firebase. Do note, to make it work locally, you will need to set up an `.env` file with the variable `VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE`, assigning it to your FIREBASE database link.

This simple project has been deployed using Vercel, you can find it [here:](https://john-15-study-dobknlygu-adrians-projects-ef5bdbb5.vercel.app)

*Do note that the sumbit buttons for the questions won't work because I have disabled writes to the firebase database.*
